## ‚ö†Ô∏è PHP 8.0 or Higher Required ‚Äì Why?

**Worry Proof Backup** is built with modern techniques to ensure your data **restores safely, quickly, and reliably** ‚Äì especially when working with large backup files.

We require **PHP 8.0 or higher** for the following reasons:

### üöÄ 1. Superior Performance

PHP 8 introduces **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compilation, which significantly speeds up operations like:

* Extracting ZIP archives with tens of thousands of files
* Reading and writing large file contents in memory
* Fast, stable looping over file lists

### üîí 2. Improved Stability and Accuracy

In PHP 7, some built-in functions like `stream_get_contents()` can behave inconsistently with large files or streams. PHP 8 provides:

* More reliable file extraction
* Fewer write failures and timeouts
* Better handling of memory streams

### üß† 3. Better File System Handling

Our plugin supports restoring entire folders with **thousands of files**, which demands fast and reliable filesystem operations ‚Äì something PHP 8 handles far better than PHP 7.

---

### üí° Still Using PHP 7?

We strongly recommend upgrading to **PHP 8.0+** for optimal compatibility, performance, and security ‚Äì not just for this plugin, but for your entire WordPress site.

Most hosting providers support PHP 8 ‚Äì feel free to reach out to your hosting support team and ask for an upgrade.
