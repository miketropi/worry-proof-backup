= ‚ö†Ô∏è PHP 8.0 or Higher Required ‚Äì Why? =

Worry Proof Backup is built with modern techniques to ensure your data restores safely, quickly, and reliably‚Äîeven when working with large backup files.

We require PHP 8.0 or higher for the following reasons:

== üöÄ 1. Superior Performance ==
PHP 8 introduces Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which significantly speeds up operations like:
* Extracting ZIP archives with tens of thousands of files
* Reading and writing large file contents in memory
* Fast, stable looping over file lists

== üîí 2. Improved Stability and Accuracy ==
In PHP 7, some built-in functions like `stream_get_contents()` can behave inconsistently with large files or streams. PHP 8 provides:
* More reliable file extraction
* Fewer write failures and timeouts
* Better handling of memory streams

== üß† 3. Better File System Handling ==
Our plugin supports restoring entire folders with thousands of files, which demands fast and reliable filesystem operations‚Äîsomething PHP 8 handles far better than PHP 7.

---

= üí° Still Using PHP 7? =
We strongly recommend upgrading to PHP 8.0+ for optimal compatibility, performance, and security‚Äînot just for this plugin, but for your entire WordPress site.

Most hosting providers support PHP 8‚Äîfeel free to reach out to your hosting support team and ask for an upgrade.
